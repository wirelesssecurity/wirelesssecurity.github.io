<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, due to the fact that it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
