<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective transgressors are less most likely to dedicate criminal activity if they think they are being enjoyed or have a higher risk of being captured. This is also known as the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance method, which argues that opportunities to upset can be reduced by changing a variety of systems such as increasing the risk of a transgressor being apprehended, increasing the effort to devote the criminal activity, decreasing benefits from criminal activity commission, and reducing provocations that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the culprit should be aware of the included surveillance for it to accomplish its wanted effect.</p>
