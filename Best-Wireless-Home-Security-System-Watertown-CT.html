Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the problem.

Ensure to have questions about the company's services and items jotted down beforehand. This will make the discussion more productive and will help you prevent upselling techniques.</p>
