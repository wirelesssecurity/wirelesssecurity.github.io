Wyze's just recently launched Complete Motion Capture fixes this issue for $1.50 monthly per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly starts another, with no spaces in between.
