As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular since the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
