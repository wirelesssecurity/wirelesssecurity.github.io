<p>first of all the plan seemed to have actually been opened when it arrived. so then I open the cameras and everything appeared OKAY up until I started to install the cameras beyond my home and discovered one one the cameras do not work and they do not come in color.

With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms happen.
