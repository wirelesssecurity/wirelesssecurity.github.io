<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with sophisticated clever home fanatics or fans of a specific ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, including creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is costly, extra sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you do not devote to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>Pricing - Vivint isn't one of the most affordable cost choices. A complete choice of equipment will cost around $2,000, and there's no money-back warranty after 3 days.
