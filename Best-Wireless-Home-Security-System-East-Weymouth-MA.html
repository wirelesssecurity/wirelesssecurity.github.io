<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests possible wrongdoers are less most likely to dedicate crime if they believe they are being viewed or have a higher risk of being captured. This is likewise called the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense prevention strategy, which argues that chances to offend can be reduced by modifying a range of systems such as increasing the threat of a wrongdoer being collared, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal activity, decreasing benefits from criminal activity commission, and decreasing provocations that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the offender needs to be aware of the included surveillance for it to achieve its wanted impact.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
<p>Geofencing: This function automates motion detection when you return or leave to a predetermined location (normally your home). By doing this, you don't have to keep in mind to switch off the camera's monitoring functions every time you come home. For this to work correctly, every user in the home (including kids) would require the app set up and geofencing allowed on their phones. We also preferred models that let you disable the automated Away alternative.</p>
