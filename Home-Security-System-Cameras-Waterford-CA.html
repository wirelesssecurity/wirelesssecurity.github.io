<p>Now let's take a look at why consumer-grade cameras are often bad night vision performers. When a camera tries to see in the dark, it requires a light source to light up the area below it.

This suggests they usually over-expose what neighbors in a scene, triggering objects and individuals to appear blown out" and without any information. So much for trying to determine the bad guys. Commercial cameras, however, frequently are equipped with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness instantly to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear properly exposed and completely detail. If a camera can not catch and provide a properly-exposed and sharp  image throughout the day and at night, it has restricted usefulness.</p>
