The control panel interacts with the other parts of the system, including the cameras, doors and window sensors, and motion sensors, to identify an intruder or something that is incorrect.

<p>The circuit and sensors alarm are monitored by the control panel - the computer system that arms the security system and identifies breaks in the electric circuit.
