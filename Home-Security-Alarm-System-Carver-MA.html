<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
