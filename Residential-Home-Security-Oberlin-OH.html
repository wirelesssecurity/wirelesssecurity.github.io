<p>The smart device app has three modes of operation-- Standby, Home, and Away. You hear a tiny chirping sound whenever the entry sensing units get set off when you position the device on Standby mode. In Home mode, a loud 93dB alarm is triggered whenever the entry sensors are triggered. Lastly, in Away mode, both the motion sensors and entry sensors are active. These are all fairly intelligent modes, but they can not be altered. You can't change the sensitivity of the sensing units or schedule them. This also leaves you susceptible to incorrect alarms, specifically if you have small kids or pets in your house. Some people choose the lack of customizability since it makes the whole gadget extremely basic to use. However it can also be a significant obstacle for some.</p>

If you desire to include a few additionals, it's easy to see how that can include up. Nevertheless, it does not play also with other devices and items, like those with Z-Wave and Zigbee compatibility, and you can't automate particular commands through IFTTT (If This Then That) yet.

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send smartphone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION).
