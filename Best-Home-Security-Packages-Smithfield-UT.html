<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Call for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small charge. Since it comes with numerous door and window sensors for full coverage, we recommend the eight-piece kit. We likewise advise including a doorbell camera eventually.
