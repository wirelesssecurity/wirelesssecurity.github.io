<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage alternative and others don't. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is recorded.

This option is generally cost-free. A cloud storage alternative saves your video in the cloud. However, this is normally a paid service and the variety of hours it will keep will depend upon just how much cloud storage you want to pay for.</p>
