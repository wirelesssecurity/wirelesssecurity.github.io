<p>CCTV cameras are better at catching bad guys after they have actually committed a crime, instead of having the ability to stop a criminal offense in progress. Someone has to be actively seeing the video screens for all 10,000 cameras if they are going to attempt to detect criminal activity before it happens. Having a a great deal of visible CCTV cameras in public areas might function as some level of deterrent, understanding you are being filmed, though most likely not watched.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to pay for your Vivint equipment up front, you're taking a look at an agreement ranging from 42 to 60 months, which is longer than a lot of companies that need a 36-month agreement.
