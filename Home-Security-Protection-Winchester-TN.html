So if you want a lawn sign with some influence to scare off prospective burglars, this one might not be as interesting you.</p>

<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
