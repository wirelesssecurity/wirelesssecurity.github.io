There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder before purchasing.</p>
