Pro-installed systems usually cost more, use equipment comparable to that of Do It Yourself systems, included typically difficult and long agreements, and typically depend on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they provide little advantage. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we have actually reviewed separately and do not recommend for many people.</p>

Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, and SimpliSafe all offer an outstanding consumer experience and instinctive, ingenious security tech. We 'd be comfy outfitting our own homes with any of them-- although each master a particular area.
