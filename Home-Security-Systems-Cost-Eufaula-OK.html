<p>A wired security system was the very first type of security system that was invented for property owners. It needs to be set up by an expert alarm installation team and, as soon as installed, is hard to move from one place to another.

<p>Like any intrusive innovation, the advantages of deploying public camera must be balanced versus the expenses and threats. This technology (a) has the possible modification the core experience of heading out in public in America since of its chilling impact on citizens, (b) brings very genuine threats of abuse and "mission creep," and (c) would not significantly secure us versus terrorism. Given that, its benefits - avoiding at most a few street criminal activities, and most likely none - are disproportionately small.</p>
