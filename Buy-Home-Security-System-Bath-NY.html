This technology assists eliminate needless alerts.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Police Department and the Village regularly get demands to waive incorrect alarm charges.

Alarms activated by electrical storms, thunder, hail, or abrupt changes in temperature do not satisfy the standards for waiver of incorrect alarm costs.
