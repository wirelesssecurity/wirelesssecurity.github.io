CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance strategy, which argues that chances to upset can be reduced by changing a range of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a wrongdoer being apprehended, increasing the effort to commit the criminal activity, reducing benefits from crime commission, and minimizing justifications that give rise to criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
