While the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution uses some protection against video searches carried out by the cops, there are presently no basic, legally enforceable rules to restrict personal privacy intrusions and protect versus abuse of CCTV systems. Guidelines are needed to develop a clear public understanding of such issues as whether video signals are tape-recorded, under what conditions, and for how long are they retained; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other government firms, or by the public; how the guidelines would be confirmed and enforced; and what penalties would apply to lawbreakers.</p>

For longer access to video, anticipate to pay a regular monthly storage cost.</p>
