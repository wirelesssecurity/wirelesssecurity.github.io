The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
