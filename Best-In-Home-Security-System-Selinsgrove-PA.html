<p>A lot of outdoor cameras, like the Arlo Ultra, provide motion detection with push and email alerts, night vision, and cloud storage for event-triggered video, and some, like the Ring Floodlight Webcam, pull double task as floodlights or porch lights. Some models can even discriminate between a passing vehicle, an animal, and a person.

Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes.

Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
