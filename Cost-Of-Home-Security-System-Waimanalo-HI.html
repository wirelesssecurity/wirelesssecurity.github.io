The Arlo Ultra does not featured a totally free tier of cloud storage, so you need to spend a minimum of $3 each month if you wish to save any videos. And if you wish to conserve 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera monthly, on top of the regular monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.
