<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<h2>The Benefits Of Monitoring Ambridge</h2>

<h3>Cheap Security Cameras in Ambridge PA</h3>
