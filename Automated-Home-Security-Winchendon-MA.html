<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
