<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
