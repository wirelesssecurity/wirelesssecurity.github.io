<p>When it comes to home security systems, Houston citizens have options. You can select a nationally recognized brand or choose a local company. Both provide similar offerings, but if you think there's a chance you might leave the Houston area in the future, you might be better off partnering with a national brand that you can take with you when you move. Due this spring, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight is an outdoor camera integrated with a 2,000-lumen light in a completely wire-free fixture. (You can pump that illuminate to 3,000 lumens by integrating the battery with outdoor cabling).
