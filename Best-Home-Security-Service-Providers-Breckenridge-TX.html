<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
