<p>Despite having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can safeguard that plug and add another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension kit, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 winds up being more expensive total per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't advise it since its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, including clever things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.
