The Angee is low on features and huge on running costs. The Ooma Butterfleye has no night vision and has bad daytime video; the Reolink C1 Pro often showed pink and green lines throughout the screen; the Yi Dome Camera constantly flickered at night; and the Samsung SmartCam had bad audio and a complicated app.</p>

We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with two Hive test units disconnecting eight times over 2 months.
